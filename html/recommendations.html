December 5, 2018, James managed Bradlee directly

Bradlee is rare in that his breadth of skills and experience allowed us to give him multiple different unrelated projects. He is a quick thinker and solves problems with eloquent solutions. He is great to work with and very detail oriented. We are very pleased with the work he has done for us.

Bradlee is upbeat, has a great sense of humor and is a pleasure to work with. I am always impressed by his ability to quickly learn new technology or code, then turn around and implement projects using that new knowledge. Bradlee is flexible, loyal and always brings fresh ideas to the table.

It was my pleasure to work with Bradlee Sargent. Bradlee did a great job for me while working for Comsys at our clients'. Each time I would check in on Bradlee's performance, he received glowing reviews from his managers and they often commented that they needed more consultants with Bradlee's work ethic. His finished product was flawless, he had a deep understanding of the technologies that he worked with and his work ethic was second to none. I would not hesitate to place Bradlee and any one of my client's to represent myself and Comsys.
