As my manager at Aetna Specialty Pharmacy, Drew Cooper put it...

Bradlee is one of those rare well-rounded technologists that comes along once every blue moon who is able to see both the tactical and strategic picture without much guidance. I interviewed and hired Bradlee as a senior java developer and never regretted a day during our tenure working together. Bradlee's uncanny ability to always map his tactical planning to the overall strategic goals of the business, of not just Aetna Specialty Pharmacy but also to corporate Aetna, set the standard by which the the balance of the development team was eventually measured. Due to his expert knowledge of java coding, he was selected to define a credible approach to a major java upgrade effort within the specialty pharmacy. He succeed effortlessly in doing just that and executed flawlessly to the plan. I would hire Bradlee anywhere anytime and would highly recommend him to any employer who is looking for a leader in java development.
